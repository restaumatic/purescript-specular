-- | A primitive similar to Dynamic. The difference is: while Dynamic always
-- | has a value, WeakDynamic has a value always after some point, but for
-- | some time after construction it may be without value.
-- |
-- | A Dynamic can be always converted to a WeakDynamic using `weaken`.
--
-- Invariant: Once the Dynamic changed to Just, it will never again turn to Nothing.
